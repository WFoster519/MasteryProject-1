	My Time on Azeroth

    <p>
	I started playing World of Warcraft around mid-2014, towards the end of the <i>Mists of Pandaria</i> expansion. I had very little idea what I was doing when I started and the only other MMO I had played before WoW was 
	Final Fantasy XI, which has very different gameplay elements. But eventually, through a random guild invitation, I found a group of people to socialize with and got to experience the joys and frustrations of raiding. 
	During that time I saved the world from several threats such an insane tyrant exploiting the powers of a dead Old God, time travelling Orcish hordes, and a space faring demonic Legion. Like I said earlier, I started toward 
	the end of <i>Mists of Pandaria</i> and continued playing until roughly a month after the release of <i>Battle for Azeroth</i>, at which point I cancelled my subscription to the game, and then regrettably had that account 
	deleted. But in late 2020 a friend of mine put the itch of WoW back in my brain, so now Iâ€™m back traversing the lands of Azeroth and beyond.
